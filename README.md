# Object Detection using Homography
This repo gives a demonstration as to how to detect any query objects which is part of the source image using the Feature matching method, and then finding the Homography. The code used, finds feature points in both the source and query images using feature descriptors like ORB, SIFT and the best pair of matches between them. 

In essence, the code returns the locations of a query object present in the source image which is sufficient to detect the query object exactly on the source Image.
